# Readme

## Descriptin
Add a directive for listening to observe intersection of an element with viewport.

## Notes
It can be activate/deactivate with the plugin active value.
It's handy in case you need to delay the observer and their actions.
Check [features/pages-transitions](https://github.com/AkaruDev/nuxt-3-templates/tree/features/pages-transitions) for an exemple.
